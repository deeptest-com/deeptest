    # Introduction
    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on
    [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.
    It was **extended** to illustrate features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
    tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) documentation. In addition to standard
    OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/main/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

    # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).
    And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.
    All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.

    # Authentication

    Petstore offers two forms of authentication:
      - API Key
      - OAuth2
    OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple
    and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
